                <summary>
                    <i>Cosumnes River College</i>, part of the <i>Los Rios Community College District</i>, is dedicated towards providing resources and 
                    services to support students and the community as a whole in having their goals through related quality services and programs. 
                    As a <em>Financial Aid Clerk</em>, working for the Financial Aid Office of the <i>Cosumnes River College</i>, I played a vital role in guiding 
                    students through the financial aid process. My <strong>responsibilities involved assisting students with their inquiries about their 
                    financial aid file, helping students get a better understanding of their Financial Aid, and advising students of financial aid 
                    policy and upcoming deadlines.</strong> With the usage of programs such as <b>OnBase</b> and <b>PeopleSoft</b>, I processed student financial aid files, 
                    managed financial aid documents, and analyzed and resolved issues within student's financial aid records by providing 
                    solutions to address the issues and when necessary, modifying a student's financial aid file to ensure students receive their 
                    financial aid in compliance with financial aid policies.
